        <section class="content"><p>In this tutorial, we will go over the steps to SSHing into your <span class="caps">VM</span>! This
is a semi-experimental tutorial, so if you have any problems please make
sure to
<a href="https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new">submit an issue</a>
and we can help make this a rock solid tutorial for all skill levels&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Note that we will only be covering Unix based OSs. If someone wants to
give me information on how this can be done on Windows, i&#39;ll be happy
to add a windows&nbsp;section!</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: As with all of these tutorials, they assume that there are no
conflicts. If you have previously attempted to install this software please
remove it fully or understand that conflicts may occur. Thanks&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following is an instructional video which approximately
mirrors the steps below. It covers both App, and Manual,&nbsp;installations.</p>

<h2>What you will&nbsp;need</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, i am going to use the terminology of “Home” and “Koding”
machines. Home being whatever the machine you are using to connect to
Koding with. Koding being the machine that is receiving the connection.
Home -&gt;&nbsp;Koding.</p>
<p>On the home machine, you will need a public rsa key <em>(usually found
in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>)</em>. If you need to generate one, please
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">refer to the Github tutorial on this</a>.
You will also need your Username, and your <span class="caps">VM</span>&nbsp;Number.</p>
<p>To find your <span class="caps">VM</span> number, open your terminal for the VM you wish to ssh into,
and look for the <em>username@vm-0:~$</em>, where <em>vm-0</em>, <em>vm-1</em>,
<em>vm-2</em>, etc, is your vm&nbsp;number.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong>: If you feel Generating an <span class="caps">SSH</span> Key would be very helpful on this
tutorial, feel free to
<a href="https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new">let me know</a>&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>Tutorial&nbsp;Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>First, copy your Public Key, usually found in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>, and copy
it in it&#39;s entirety! It will look something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCyhKankDE4DRM86JqZ3JPdWDeqg+TbzlqlTLf
OKTeokhRoMgy5WoMY/ZWUVES3d2vSHHwW3cwWlELmVdc3Ow57boZv3fOsPhybYHVRTClXYr1ncS
xyTvjvCfvV5q22aIxHPWQ353543ssda87sa+85XEa4VnveJsEzxBZl4oJ4GB0AGa48+UdIqutrg
Zu7D7JCK+Yl228X+3bJf3ddlqDaKaVXPivvvYqImK6ZwFsxh2lNO4E8IOd3OSK9zv6i+io8PxWm
wP0tLFokxulAI8Td1sOPBE9s9bdJ5c2T/GfGjKF+aNKsd33TsYEjjc/plMZmRRrOgQwre6OAkgM
vyV2X foo@bar.baz</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Next, paste this entire Public Key into your <span class="caps">SSH</span> Keys section of your
Account settings. This can be found by going to
<a href="https://koding.com/Account">koding/Account</a> and clicking <span class="caps">SSH</span> Keys
under the DEVELOP. Click the Plus button on the right side of the page,
and paste your Public Key into this. Below is a screenshot of this area
for clarification.
<img src="/koding-unofficial/guides/ssh-into-your-vm/sshkeys.png" alt="Koding SSH Keys"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to your Home machine, and create the file
<code>~/.ssh/config</code> <em>(assuming it&#39;s not already created)</em>. Add the following
code into that&nbsp;file:</p>
<pre><code>Host *.kd.io
 User &lt;username&gt;
 ProxyCommand ssh %r@ssh.koding.com nc %h %p</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> is your username, without the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, on your Home machine and connect to your <span class="caps">VM</span>! This can be
done by typing: <code>ssh &lt;vm-Number&gt;.&lt;username&gt;.koding.kd.io</code>. An example,
here is my connection command: <code>ssh vm-0.leeolayvar.koding.kd.io</code>.</p>
<p>You will have to enter your local <span class="caps">SSH</span> password, if you chose one when you
created your key. After that, presented with <code>username@vm-X:~$</code>, singaling
that you have connected&nbsp;successfully.</p>
<h4>Possible Gotcha:&nbsp;~/.ssh/authorized_keys</h4>
<p>You do <em>not</em> need to use authorized_keys in the Koding VMs. The
Account Settings -&gt; <span class="caps">SSH</span> Keys takes care of the authorization for&nbsp;you.</p>
<h4>Possible Gotcha: Agent admitted&nbsp;failure?</h4>
<p>If you receive an error when you attempt to connect, matching the following&nbsp;description:</p>
<pre><code>Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.</code></pre>
<p>Then run the command <code>ssh-add</code>. For additional information on this gotcha,
see the
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/error-agent-admitted-failure-to-sign">Github Help Page</a>
on the&nbsp;subject.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Confirming your&nbsp;Installation</h2>
<p>The best way to confirm your installation is simply by connecting to your
Koding <span class="caps">VM</span>. For information on this, see Step #3&nbsp;above.</p>

      <section class="about"><h4>Having Trouble, or Is Something Outdated?</h4>
<p>Koding changes quite rapidly, so if one of these guides are outdated,
or if something just doesn&#39;t quite make sense to you, please
<a href="https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on the matter. Doing this will help me keep these guides
up to date, and help any Koders using these guides after you. Thanks!</p>
