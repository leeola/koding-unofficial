        <section class="content"><p>In this tutorial, i will go over how to get your <span class="caps">FTP</span> Client connected
to your VM&#39;s FTP Server. I will cover both App Installation, and Manual
installation of your VM server, as well as the basics of the FTP Client
settings. In this guide, we are using
<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> as the <span class="caps">FTP</span>&nbsp;Client.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: As with all of these tutorials, they assume that there are no
conflicts. If you have previously attempted to install this software please
remove it fully or understand that conflicts may occur. Thanks&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following is an instructional video which approximately
mirrors the steps below. It covers both App, and Manual,&nbsp;installations.</p>
<iframe width="680" height="450" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1Boyf-vYXUI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<h2>What you will&nbsp;need</h2>
<p>In this tutorial you will need three things. Your Koding username,
Koding password, and your <span class="caps">VM</span>&nbsp;Number.</p>
<p>To find your <span class="caps">VM</span> number, open your terminal for the VM you wish to install
PureFTPd on, and look for the <em>username@vm-0:~$</em>, where <em>vm-0</em>, <em>vm-1</em>,
<em>vm-2</em>, etc, is your vm number. This will be needed, to connect to your
PureFTPd&nbsp;server.</p>
<h2>Steps for Installation with Koding&nbsp;App</h2>
<p>The Koding App installation is the installation that most people will want.
It&#39;s the easiest, but will only work for your first <span class="caps">VM</span> currently. If you
need to install
PureFTPd
on any VM other than your first, please see the Manual Installation
section&nbsp;below.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, we are going to go to the
<a href="https://koding.com/Apps">koding/Apps</a> listing, and click the
<a href="https://koding.com/Apps/pureftpd-installer">PureFTPd Installer</a>. Next,
click the <strong>“Install Now”</strong> button in the upper&nbsp;left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, now that you have added the PureFTPd Installer App to Your Apps,
click on the
<a href="https://koding.com/Develop/PureFTPd%20Installer">PureFTPd App</a>
in Your Apps. Once it loads, in the upper right corner click
the <strong>Install</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>A terminal will now popup in the lower section of the App. This is where
we will be handling the rest of the commands for this&nbsp;installation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter your Koding password, which is your root&nbsp;password.</p>
<h4>Possible Gotcha: Unmet&nbsp;Dependancies?</h4>
<p>If, after entering your password, you run into a screen that looks like this:
<img src="/koding-unofficial/guides/setting-up-ftp/unmetdeps.png" alt="Unment Dependencies"></p>
<p>Type in the following&nbsp;command</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get -f install</code></p>
<p>Once the command has finished executing,
click the <strong>Install</strong> button in the upper right again. You should
not run into this a second time. Proceed to the next step after clicking
the <strong>Install</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a bunch of text whizzes by with no visible errors, Congratulations!
You now have a working <span class="caps">FTP</span> server on this VM! Next up, we need to connect
to our FTP Server with our FTP&nbsp;Client!</p>
<p>To do this, we are going to open up FileZilla and press <strong>Ctrl-S</strong>, to open
up our site manager. You can also open this by going to
<strong>File -&gt; Site Manager</strong>. When the Site Manager pops up, click the
<strong>“New Site”</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, the last step is to enter our PureFTPd information! Enter the following
information into your New Site. Replace <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> with your username,
and <code>&lt;vm-Number&gt;</code> with your <span class="caps">VM</span> Number; So that <code>&lt;vm-Number&gt;</code> becomes <em>vm-0</em>,
<em>vm-1</em>,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<pre><code>Host: &lt;username&gt;.kd.io
Encryption: Use plain FTP
Login Type: Normal
User: &lt;username&gt;@&lt;vm-Number&gt;.&lt;username&gt;.koding.kd.io
Password: &lt;your koding password&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="caps">FTP</span> Username, when filled out, should look like
<code>leeolayvar@vm-0.leeolayvar.koding.kd.io</code>. Make sure the end looks
like <em>koding.kd.io</em>, it is&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>If you have any confusion about where to enter this information,
please refer to the video or the image&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><img src="/koding-unofficial/guides/setting-up-ftp/ftpclientsettings.png" alt="FTP Client Settings"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Steps for Manual&nbsp;Installation</h2>
<p>Installing PureFTPd is probably the easiest “manual” installation there is.
It is just one command, and the rest is identical to the App Installer above.
So after Step 1, refer to the above steps. The video also covers this
installation, in basic&nbsp;detail.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install the PureFTPd apt-get package, by entering the following command:
<code>sudo apt-get install pure-ftpd</code></p>
<p>Then proceed to Step #3 in the above Koding App Installation&nbsp;steps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Confirming your&nbsp;Installation</h2>
<p>Connecting to your <span class="caps">FTP</span> Server with your FTP Client is the easiest way
to confirm it is working, but what if that fails? Is your Server&nbsp;running?</p>
<p>To find this out, run the following command: <code>ps aux | grep ftpd</code>. This
will print the running processes that contain the text “ftpd”. What you are
looking for, is a line containing <strong>“<span class="caps">PURE</span>-FTPD (SERVER)”</strong>. If you see that,
your server is running, and the problem is likely not your&nbsp;server.</p>

      <section class="about"><h4>Having Trouble, or Is Something Outdated?</h4>
<p>Koding changes quite rapidly, so if one of these guides are outdated,
or if something just doesn&#39;t quite make sense to you, please
<a href="https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on the matter. Doing this will help me keep these guides
up to date, and help any Koders using these guides after you. Thanks!</p>
