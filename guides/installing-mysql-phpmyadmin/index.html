<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: As with all of these tutorials, they assume that there are no
conflicts. If you have previously attempted to install this software please
remove it fully or understand that conflicts may occur. Thanks&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following is an instructional video which approximately
mirrors the steps below. It covers both App, and Manual,&nbsp;installations.</p>

<h2>What you will&nbsp;need</h2>
<p>MySQL and phpyMyAdmin installation only requires knowledge of your Koding
username, your Koding password, and for phpMyAdmin, the <span class="caps">VM</span> connection url.
Your VM url will look like <a href="http://username.kd.io/"><a href="http://username.kd.io">http://username.kd.io</a></a>,
<a href="http://vm-0.username.kd.io/"><a href="http://vm-0.username.kd.io">http://vm-0.username.kd.io</a></a>,
<a href="http://vm-1.username.kd.io/"><a href="http://vm-1.username.kd.io">http://vm-1.username.kd.io</a></a>, etc. If you have
any questions on how you can find this, please watch the video, as i go
over the What You Need section in the&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<h2>Steps for Installing with the Koding&nbsp;App</h2>
<p>The Koding App installation is the installation that most people will want.
It&#39;s the easiest, but will only work for your first <span class="caps">VM</span> currently. If you
need to install
MySQL and phpMyAdmin
on any VM other than your first, please see the Manual Installation
section&nbsp;below.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to <a href="https://koding.com/Apps">koding.com/Apps</a> and select the
MySQL Installer application, and click Install&nbsp;Now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate to <a href="https://koding.com/Develop">Your Apps</a> and select your newly
installed application, and in the upper right of the
<a href="https://koding.com/Develop/MySQL%20Installer">application page</a>,
click&nbsp;Install.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You will then be presented with a terminal on the bottom of your window.
This terminal will be asking for your sudo password, which is Koding password,
so enter that now. <strong>Note</strong> that even though it does not show you typing, it is
still accepting your&nbsp;input.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the next prompt, press Enter to accept the&nbsp;installation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next you will be prompted for your MySQL Root Password. After you have
entered it, repeat the password at the next&nbsp;prompt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The following prompt asks which web server to configure. Apache2 should
already be selected, press Enter. What follows will be a lot of text,
showing various installation&nbsp;messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next you have to configure phpMyAdmin. This step will handle setting
default configs up. Select Yes, and press&nbsp;Enter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now you have to give phpMyAdmin your <strong>MySQL</strong> Root Password. Next,
type in the app password. This can be autogenerated, or hand selected.
Enter or leave it blank, and press&nbsp;Enter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are almost done! Now MySQL and phpMyAdmin should be running! Your last
step, is to configure Apache, to know where to look for phpMyAdmin. To do
this, you can run the following command. It will need your password, so
provide it when&nbsp;prompted:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apache2/apache2.conf &amp;&amp; sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can select and copy this command with Ctrl-C, and paste it
into your Terminal with Ctrl-<em>Shift</em>-V.</p>
</li>
<li><p>That&#39;s it! You should now have a working MySQL database, and you can
connect to phpMyAdmin at the url
<a href="http://username.kd.io/phpMyAdmin">http://<username>.kd.io/phpMyAdmin</a>!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Steps for Manual&nbsp;Installation</h2>
<p>The manual steps only differ from the app steps by the first step. Due 
to this, i am going to simply provide the first step, and steps #2-10 can be
followed above in the <strong>“Steps for Installing with the Koding App”</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First off, we are going to apt-get install mysql-server, mysql-client, and
phpmyadmin. The command for that is as follows:
<code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client phpmyadmin</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Follow App Installation steps above, #2 through #10&nbsp;:)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Confirming your&nbsp;Installation</h2>
<h3>Confirming&nbsp;MySQL</h3>
<p>You can connect to your MySQL server via the command line to ensure it is
running, and you know the username <span class="amp">&amp;</span> password. To do this, type the following
command: <code>mysql -uroot -p&lt;password&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;password&gt;</code> is your password,
without the brackets. If you are successful, you will be in the
mysql client, your terminal will look like <code>mysql&gt;</code>, and your
MySQL server is running successfully. To leave, press <strong>Ctrl-D</strong>.</p>
<h3>Confirming&nbsp;phpMyAdmin</h3>
<p>To confirm phpMyAdmin&#39;s correct installation, simply connect to
<a href="http://username.kd.io/phpmyadmin"><a href="http://username.kd.io/phpmyadmin">http://username.kd.io/phpmyadmin</a></a>,
or if you installed on the non-default <span class="caps">VM</span>, connect to the vm directly via
<a href="http://vm-1.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin"><a href="http://vm-1.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin">http://vm-1.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin</a></a>,
<a href="http://vm-2.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin"><a href="http://vm-2.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin">http://vm-2.username.kd.io/phpmyadmin</a></a>,
etc. If you see phpMyAdmin, you have successfully installed phpMyadmin&nbsp;:)</p>

      <section class="about"><h4>Having Trouble, or Is Something Outdated?</h4>
<p>Koding changes quite rapidly, so if one of these guides are outdated,
or if something just doesn&#39;t quite make sense to you, please
<a href="https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on the matter. Doing this will help me keep these guides
up to date, and help any Koders using these guides after you. Thanks!</p>
